                <p>I was born in Poznań on the 6th of July and have been interested in computer ever since I got an old computer from my sister at the age of 6. I've been studying computer science to get a degree for the past 2 years. My main interests in the field are web development, ML and AI but I'm willing to study and learn anything as long as it's interesting. I mostly focus on JavaScript (react, bootstrap, nodejs) but also dabble in HTML, CSS, C#, C++ and Python.</p>
